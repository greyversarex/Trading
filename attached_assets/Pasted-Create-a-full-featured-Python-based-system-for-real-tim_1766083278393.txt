Create a full-featured Python-based system for real-time detection of visually similar PRICE STRUCTURES on cryptocurrency charts.

PROJECT PURPOSE:
Build a personal analytical tool that continuously scans the cryptocurrency market (Binance) and finds charts whose PRICE STRUCTURE is visually similar to a structure provided by the user via a screenshot.

This project is focused on STRUCTURAL VISUAL SIMILARITY, not numerical indicators.

THIS IS NOT:
- Indicator-based analysis
- Candle counting
- Fixed time alignment
- Prediction or trading signal generation

CORE CONCEPT:
The system must extract an ABSTRACT STRUCTURAL REPRESENTATION of a chart, not compare raw images.

The structure consists of:
- Key swing / pivot points
- Relative distances between pivots
- Directional sequence
- Compression / expansion behavior
- Overall geometric shape of price movement

INPUT:
- User uploads any screenshot of a price chart (any platform, any style).
- Screenshot may contain noise (UI, grids, axes, labels).
- Screenshot may represent only a fragment of a chart.

IMAGE PROCESSING:
1. Automatically detect and isolate the price line from the screenshot.
2. Remove all irrelevant elements (background, grid, UI).
3. Convert the detected price into a single continuous LINE.
4. Normalize the line:
   - scale-invariant
   - volatility-invariant
   - time-invariant
5. Extract structural features from the line:
   - pivot points (local highs/lows)
   - relative geometry between points
   - trend tendency
   - compression / consolidation behavior

STRUCTURE TYPES (automatic classification):
- Compression
- Accumulation
- Triangle
- Range
- Retest
- Unknown / hybrid

LIVE MARKET SCANNING:
- Market: Cryptocurrency
- Exchange: Binance
- Instruments: 50–500 trading pairs
- Data source: Binance WebSocket API
- Continuous 24/7 scanning

TIMEFRAMES:
The system must generate and analyze structures on multiple timeframes:
- 30 seconds
- 1 minute
- 3 minutes
- 5 minutes
- 15 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 1 hour

STRUCTURE EXTRACTION FROM LIVE DATA:
1. Build price lines from live candle data.
2. Apply the same normalization and structure extraction logic as used for screenshots.
3. Structures must be:
   - scale-invariant
   - volatility-independent
   - tolerant to different lengths
   - mirror-invariant (bullish and bearish symmetry supported)

MATCHING LOGIC:
- Compare STRUCTURE TO STRUCTURE, not image to image.
- Use geometric and relational similarity.
- Prioritize maximum accuracy over speed.
- Similarity score must be normalized (0–100%).
- User must be able to set a minimum similarity threshold.
- Return ALL matches above the threshold.

RESULT PRESENTATION:
Display results in a table containing:
- Trading pair
- Timeframe
- Detected structure type
- Similarity score
- Live chart preview
- Timestamp

HISTORICAL CONTEXT (NO FORECASTING):
- Allow searching historical data for past structures similar to the uploaded one.
- Show what happened AFTER similar structures in the past.
- Provide raw outcomes only, no predictions or signals.

USER FEEDBACK & LEARNING:
- User can mark matches as:
  - relevant
  - irrelevant
- System adjusts internal similarity weighting based on feedback.

DATA STORAGE:
- Store:
  - Uploaded structures
  - Detected matches
  - User feedback
  - Historical structure library

TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS:
Backend:
- Python
- FastAPI
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- WebSockets
- SQLite or PostgreSQL

Frontend:
- Simple web interface
- Screenshot upload
- Similarity threshold control
- Start / stop continuous scan
- Live-updating results table

NON-GOALS:
- No RSI, MACD, indicators
- No buy/sell signals
- No price prediction
- No fixed candle pattern rules

FINAL RESULT:
A working system that:
- Accepts any chart screenshot
- Extracts its abstract price structure
- Continuously scans Binance markets
- Finds and displays visually and structurally similar price movements in real time
